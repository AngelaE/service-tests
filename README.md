# .NET OpenApi Sample with Client

This is a sample project showing some basic asp.netcore integration testing.

Features:
* include service log output
* how to use an autorest generated client
* test downstream dependencies with wiremock.net

The code in this repository is not ready for use in production! The API does not conform to REST standards, and the test code is very rough.
