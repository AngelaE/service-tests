# API Test Samples

This is a sample project showing different types of tests for a .NET Core API.

Samples:
* [Component/Integration tests with Mountebank](./external-tests)
* [Integration tests with ASP.NET Test Host)](./src/book.integrationtests)
  * include service log output
  * how to use an autorest generated client
  * test downstream dependencies with wiremock.net

The code in this repository is not ready for use in production! 
The API does not conform to REST standards, and the test code is very rough.
The code in this repository is optimized for easy reading and explaining tests. It is not ready for use in production.
